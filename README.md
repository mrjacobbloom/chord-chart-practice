# chord-chart-practice
A little tool that prints out random chords at a given tempo, which I've been using to practice jazz chords/keeping up with a chord chart. It has options to configure tempo, time-signature, and whether to simplify enharmonic chords like Fb or B#.

The set of possible chord qualities/aliases for those chord qualities is definitely not exhaustive. If there's one you'd like me to add, open an issue (or a PR)

```bash
# to run:
npm start
```
